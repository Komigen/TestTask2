# TestTask3

Test task on knowledge of data structures and methods for working with them in 🔨Swift.

## 📝 Task text
 The task is to implement the Shop protocol (you can do that in this file directly).
 - No database or any other storage is required, just store data in memory
 - No any smart search, use String method contains (case sensitive/insensitive - does not matter)
 – Performance optimizations for listProductsByName and listProductsByProducer are optional
